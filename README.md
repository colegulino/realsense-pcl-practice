This is some basic pcl and realsense practice that I am doing to gain some knowledge about how to use PCL and the realsense camera.

Libraries that I use:
* Library for interfacing with the realsense: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
* PCL 1.8: http://pointclouds.org/
-- Installed on Mac 10.11 with Homebrew: http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/installing_homebrew.php

Tutorial I followed to get started:
* http://www.joshmcculloch.nz/#!realsense

Making the files:
* `cmake --build build -- -j3`

Running the script:
* `./bin/demo`
